# Topic

In this project I tried to predict life expectation of people from differant countries.

# Brife explanation of notebook

As usual I started with extracting information and encoding my features then I removed noises (*without any special methods just using histogram*) and I made the model.

# Results

- First model got a 12 mse which means almos 3.5 tolerance from the center of the main number and it is good
- Second model worked a little bit and got 121 mse
