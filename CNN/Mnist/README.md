# Overviwe 

This is the most known mnist dataset I tried to load and predict the classify tha pictures based on the datas of each pixels. I used CNN and the most
basic network with a con2d layer a pooling layer a flattening layer and a dense layer. I think that though the model acted perfectly but if I chainge the 
layers and their features I might get a better result. Also I am currently using cpu version and it took me about 3 4 minutes to fit the model
I will try my gpu and compare these two at the ending of this readme.
