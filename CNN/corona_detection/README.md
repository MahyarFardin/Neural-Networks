# Overviwe 

In this project I tried to predict the corona based on the pictures of lungs, first I tried to find the suitable channel number for it then I tried to make model more complex and pictures with less resolutions(because a virus shows it self infecting an area instead of spot I dont need high resolution pictures).


# Problems 
- [x] Pictures were black and white but they had 4 channels. 

- [x] Pictures had differant resolutions.


# Results


# For the channel selection part


	# With 4 channels

 	# With 3 channels

 	# With one channel
