This is the most known mnist dataset I tried to load and predict the classify tha pictures based on the datas of each pixels. I used CNN and the most
basic network with a con2d layer a pooling layer a flattening layer and a dense layer. I think that though the model acted perfectly but if I chainge the 
layers and their features I might get a better result.
