# Overviwe 

In this project I try to predict some hand written digits and mathematical signs.

# Problems 

1. Pictures were black and white but they had three channels.(*Not handeled*) 
2. Pictures had differant resolutions. (*Handeled*)

# Next update

I will add normalizer and will handle the first issue.
